                Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or
                BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG
                Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and
                Lisa. The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album
                Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their
                first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and
                the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.

              <p>
                Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts
                worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl
                group after launching its first major girl group, 2NE1, in 2009.
                According to the members, joining the label as trainees was
                similar to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with
                Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school"
                and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For
                members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the
                pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially
                difficult. Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as
                2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their
                new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature
                at least seven members. Since then, numerous news and rumors
                surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed,
                although there had been no official information. It was only
                until May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl
                group would debut that July, stating that the members were
                selected through years of stiff competition. The label later
                confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to
                the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not
                included in the lineup.

              <p>
                Regarding the meaning of the name Black Pink, the representative
                of YG Entertainment said that the name is to refute the popular
                perception of pink. Usually pink is used with the meaning of
                beauty. With Black Pink, "beauty is not everything" - that is,
                in addition to possessing a beautiful appearance, the group is
                also extremely talented and personable. When naming meaningful
                brands, the impression of the name Black Pink has contributed to
                helping the audience remember them longer and easier.
